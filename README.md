# Airport

This code is a program for an airport that lets passengers and employees choose options from a menu. It starts by displaying a welcome message, and then it prompts the user to select either passenger or employee. If the user chooses passenger, they are prompted to select a destination from America, Europe, and Africa. If the user chooses America, they are prompted to input their first name and visa number. The program checks the validity of the visa number and saves the information into a file called "America.txt" if the visa number is valid. If the user chooses Europe, they are prompted to input their Schengen number, and the program checks the validity of the Schengen number and determines the corresponding country. The information is then saved into a file called "Europe.txt". If the user chooses Africa, the program prints a message that says "Coming soon!" and returns to the previous menu. If the user chooses employee, the program calls the Employee() function. The program ends if the user selects the Quit option.
